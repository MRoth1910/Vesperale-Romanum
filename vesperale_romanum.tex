%%\customsubfile{vr_NN_prop_gallia} if feeling ambitious
%% antique hymns (texts only? melodies as in AR 1911 and therefore LU/LA…_

\customsubfile{vr_NN_pius_xii} %%(tbd if Anthony and Lawrence go here for "O Doctor Optime")

\customsubfile{vr_NN_variationes} %% Rubrical changes up to 1960

%%NN to be replaced with 01, 02… like Matthias does with Nocturnale

%% \chapter needs to be able to take optional argument which it SHOULD by default %%what needs to be \chapter, \section etc isn't clear in my own head (as of Sept 2023)

%% Chapter title needs to be at top of page (this should be fixed now in the commonheaders file as of 14/06/23 and revised as of 14/06/2024)

%% need to decide on default indention (i.e. none) after sectioning commands or use \indent\indent

%% Need multiple (sub-)section styles AND we need some (most!) (sub-)sections to not be in TOC at all
%% need to decide on handling dates in body of antiphonal as well as style for Double II class (bigger title case or bigger all-caps) and other feasts/days
%% bigtitle works for Sabbato, Dominica, Feria II etc. but maybe that's not appropriate!
%% the question is how to appropriately use LaTeX sectioning commands and header (titlesec and fancyhdr packages, probably) while respecting divisions of an antiphonal and having appropriate headings
%% can't forget that the pageref is often the page after the incipit (bad!)
%%babel always has -ct division (should we keep this for readings/chapter and collect or no? to manually edit or no? ditto pt and similar combinations)

%%section title can never begin at bottom of page, but we don't always want empty style (big feasts, new "chapter" only)
%% can never split day (e.g. Feria VI post…)/date, rank, octave from feast title

%%can never split IN I (II) VESPERIS or similar, but they can be split from rubrics (probably?)

%% need to account for psalm repetition as well as tex files (the endings mostly don't matter but are helpful when looking at the code; star files can eventually be untracked and deleted, but Magnificat files in modes 3 and 4 must remain separate 

%%if compiling with consecutive page numbers in subfile pdf, then following must be before \begin{document} of each subfile; use \customsubfile 
%%
%%\ifcsname preamble@file\endcsname
%%  \setcounter{page}{\getpagerefnumber{M-feria_2}}
%%\fi

%% ALT with descenders (normally p and y) particularly in italics causes issues on second pass. 1st pass is perfect. but default tends to make the score too big. Will need to carefully scrutinize lines in certain scores lest the pages be too stretched. This is a problem for common tones and for Magnificats with tone endings printed as in Liber Usualis.

%%we do not want beginnings of psalm verse to stretch (this always happens with "Sicut"
%%Update Dec 4, 2023: this is because of the spacing defaults with periods. Sometimes, it becomes a sentence space. %%Update Dec 21 2023: frenchspacing plus more advanced LaTeX *may* resolve this, because even frenchspacing still leaves big spaces and doesn't treat the same characters the same way every time

%% update May 18 2024, no this is fixed with switch to enumerate environment and labelsep being set to 3pt. 
%%underfull hbox is a problem for psalms which is now in mddle of line instead of right after number and period at beginning.


%%\lettrine[depth=1] should probably be used consistently with Q (collects starting "Quaesumus")

%%there should be period after Scripture verse

%% 1960 will need Vespers for Holy Saturday and rubrics blahblahblah for Thursday and Friday if we choose to do a 1960 supplement (and really, do we need the whole list of things to change for that…)

%%every label seems to need \phantomsection. Unclear why code won't supply it

%%need to check offset of asterisk in antiphons; the (default) new barspacing algorithm works, but e.g. Sicut novellae of Corpus Christi has the asterisk to the far right of the quarter bar, when in this case it should be aligned neatly

%% verse numbers of hymn always need to go on next line… this is a bad limitaation of Gregorio

%%probably should remove all labels that only go from I or II Vespers to the same EXCEPT for page numbers (so in other words, chapter and hymn don't get label and  pageref, but psalms do, because otherrwise it could be another feast, common, etc.)
%%this makes life easier and cuts down on number of labels substantially

%%need to follow this format in commons where last psalm and verse change between 2 Vespers
